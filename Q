1. Why Conversion of Bra to Ket & Ket to bra is being performed?
Ans. 
In general, the vectors are represented in Ket format only i.e., as column matrix.
But if we want to perform any operation on that vector i.e, KET we cannot directly multiply another column matrix to a column matrix.
So the corresponding operation is converted into row matrix from column matrix.
when we mulitply row matrix with column matrix we get the result.

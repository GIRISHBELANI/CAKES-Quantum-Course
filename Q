1. Why Conversion of Bra to Ket & Ket to bra is being performed? in terms of "complex conjugate matrix "
Ans. 
In general, the vectors are represented in Ket format only i.e., as column matrix.
But if we want to perform any operation on that vector i.e, KET we cannot directly multiply another column matrix to a column matrix.
So the corresponding operation is converted into row matrix from column matrix.
when we mulitply row matrix with column matrix we get the result. 

2. Why Unitary Matrices are being used in Quantum Computing ?and what is unitary matrix?
Ans.
Key Characteristics of Unitary Operations:
1. Preservation of Norm: 
	A unitary operation preserves the normalization of quantum states. That is, the operation doesn’t change the length (or norm) 
	of the quantum state vectors.
	Mathematically, for a quantum state vector |𝜓⟩, after applying a unitary operation 𝑈 , the norm remains unchanged: ‖𝑈 |𝜓⟩‖ = ‖|𝜓⟩‖.
2. Reversibility: 
	Unitary operations are reversible transformations. This means that for every unitary operation applied to a quantum state,
	there exists an inverse operation that can revert the state back to its original form.
3. Compositions of Unitary Operations: 
	When multiple unitary operations are applied sequentially (in a sequence known as a quantum circuit), 
	the resulting transformation remains unitary. 
	This property is crucial in quantum algorithms, where sequences of unitary gates represent computations.
	
	
3. What is Hilbert space and why hilbert??
Ans.
Hilbert Space : It is a complex multidimenstional vector space where inner product of any pair
of elements is defined as extrapolation of a 2D Space to n-Dimensions and Complex coeﬀicients.
• |0⟩, |1⟩ are considered as the standard basis states also as orthonormal basis states.
• Consider a 2D plane with an x-axis and y-axis and we have a unit vector that aligns with
x-axis and a unit vector that aligns with y-axis.
• Now we can represent any point on 2D plane as the linear combination of unit vectors of x
and y.
• Hilbert space is similar to to it. Here the coeﬀicients are complex numbers so the mathematics
remains very similar.
• It is just like we are having different kind of space and, standard basis roughly equivalent to
our i & j vectors on a 2D plane which they represent orthonormal basis states.(They are
perpendicular to each other).
